# Spine-Abnormality-Detection-Using-ANN
This project focuses on automated spine abnormality detection, classifying individuals as "normal" or "abnormal" based on physical spine data using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). It seeks to provide a tool for identifying potential lower back pain risks, helping healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning.
